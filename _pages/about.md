Hi, I'm Jesús Vellojin, a Colombian mathematician working on numerical analysis and computational modeling, areas 
applied to problems of solid mechanics, fluids and viscoelastic structures. I got my math degree at [Universidad de 
Cartagena](https://www.instagram.com/unicartagena/?hl=es). I have a master degree in math from [Universidad del 
Norte](https://www.uninorte.edu.co), Barranquilla, Colombia. I got my phD through 
a consortium of Chilean universities: [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://usm.cl), [Pontificia 
Universidad Católica de Valparaíso](https://www.pucv.cl) and [Universidad de Valparaíso](https://uv.cl).

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [GIMNAP-Universidad del Bío-Bío](http://ciencias.ubiobio.cl/gimnap/) through ANID 
postdoctoral project 3230302 under 
the sponsorship of my colleague and friend [Dr. David Mora](http://ciencias.ubiobio.cl/dmora/). My research focuses on the numerical solution of partial 
differential equations, mixed formulations, and locking-free 
methods for slender structures, with applications in water desalination, elasticity problems, fluid-flow problems, 
coupled problems, and eigenvalue problems.

In my free time I enjoy watching Youtube science channels, playing chess, learning new programming languages and 
cooking. I enjoy Chilean food very much and I have learned to make fusion meals where I mix the best of Chile and Colombia.
