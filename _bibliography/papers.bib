      abstract={In this paper we present a mathematical and numerical analysis of an eigenvalue problem associated to the elasticity-Stokes equations stated in two and three dimensions. Both problems are related through the Herrmann pressure. Employing the Babu\v ska--Brezzi theory, it is proved that the resulting continuous and discrete variational formulations are well-posed. In particular, the finite element method is based on general inf-sup stables pairs for the Stokes system, such that, Taylor--Hood finite elements. By using a general approximation theory for compact operators, we obtain optimal order error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues. Under mild assumptions, we have that these estimates hold with constants independent of the Lamé coefficient λ. In addition, we carry out the reliability and efficiency analysis of a residual-based a posteriori error estimator for the spectral problem. We report a series of numerical tests in order to assess the performance of the method and its behavior when the nearly incompressible case of elasticity is considered.},

      abstract={We propose a model for the coupling of flow and transport equations with porous membrane-type conditions on part of the boundary. The governing equations consist of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations coupled with an advection-diffusion equation, and we employ a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the coupling between penetration velocity and transport on the membrane, while mixed boundary conditions are considered in the remainder of the boundary. We show existence and uniqueness of the continuous problem using a fixed-point argument. Next, an H(div)-conforming finite element formulation is proposed, and we address its a priori error analysis. The method uses an upwind approach that provides stability in the convection-dominated regime. We showcase a set of numerical examples validating the theory and illustrating the use of the new methods in the simulation of reverse osmosis processes.},

abstract={The present paper introduces the analysis of the eigenvalue problem for the elasticity equations when the so-called Navier-Lam\'e system is considered. This system incorporates the displacement, rotation, and pressure of a linear elastic structure. The analysis of the spectral problem is based on the compact operator theory. A finite element method using polynomials of degree $k \geq 1$ is employed to approximate the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the system. Convergence and error estimates are presented. An a posteriori error analysis is also performed, where the reliability and efficiency of the proposed estimator are proven. We conclude this contribution by reporting a series of numerical tests to assess the performance of the proposed numerical method for both a priori and a posteriori estimates.},

The stress tensor is written in terms of the vorticity of the fluid, leading to an alternative mixed formulation that incorporates this physical feature. We propose a mixed numerical method where the stress is approximated with suitable Nédelec finite elements, whereas the velocity is approximated with piecewise polynomials of degree k≥0. With the aid of the compact operators theory we derive convergence of the method and spectral correctness. Moreover, we propose a reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimator for our spectral problem in order to provide an adaptive strategy to achieve the optimal order of convergence for non sufficient smooth eigenfunctions. We report numerical tests where the spectrum is computed, together with a computational analysis for the proposed estimator. In addition, we use the corresponding error estimator to drive an adaptive scheme, and we report the results of a numerical test, that allow us to assess the performance of this approach.}

Under the approach of the non-compact operators theory, we prove convergence and error estimates for the method when the displacement formulation is considered. We analyze the influence of the stabilization parameter on the computation of the spectrum, where spurious eigenmodes arise when this parameter is not correctly chosen. Alternatively we present the formulation depending only on the pressure, comparing the performance of the DG methods with the pure displacement formulation. Computationally, we study the influence of the stabilization parameter on the arising of spurious eigenvalues when the spectrum is computed.

The fluid is modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations and the solution-diffusion is used to impose the momentum balance on the membrane. The scheme consist of a conforming finite element method with the velocity–pressure formulation for the Navier–Stokes equations, together with a primal scheme for the convection–diffusion equations. The Nitsche's method is used to impose the permeability condition across the membrane. Several numerical experiments are performed to show the robustness of the method. The resulting model accurately replicates the analytical models and predicts similar results to previous works. It is found that the submerged configuration has the highest permeate production, but also has the greatest pressure loss of all three configurations studied.},
