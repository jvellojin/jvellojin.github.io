A mixed method framework is used to provide stability and semi-discrete error estimates that do not deteriorate as the thickness parameter becomes small. Numerical experiments for both quasi-static and transient cases are presented.}

abstract = {In this paper, we study thin viscoelastic shell structures using a constitutive equation in hereditary integral form. An alternative mathematical formulations for several viscoelastic shell structures under the Reissner–Mindlin kinematical assumptions are obtained. The resulting equations are written as a Volterra equation of the second kind to allow further mathematical analysis. A locking-free finite element formulation, with selective reduced integration is used to approximate the equation. To perform numerical experiments we consider several situations suffering from locking in both cases dynamic and quasi-static. We show the good behavior of the model compared with other models from the literature.}

    abstract = { In two and three dimensions, we analyze mixed finite element methods for a velocity-pressure-pseudostress formulation of the Stokes eigenvalue problem. The methods consist of two schemes: the velocity and pressure are approximated with piecewise polynomial, whereas for the pseudostress we consider two classic families of finite elements for \${H}(\div)\$ spaces: the Raviart--Thomas and the Brezzi--Douglas--Marini elements. With the aid of the classic spectral theory for compact operators, we prove that our method does not introduce spurious modes. Also, we obtain convergence and error estimates for the proposed methods. We report numerical results to compare the accuracy and robustness between both numerical schemes. }

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze a mixed formulation for the two dimensional Stokes eigenvalue problem where the unknowns are the stress and the velocity, whereas the pressure can be recovered with a simple postprocess of the stress. The stress tensor is written in terms of the vorticity of the fluid, leading to an alternative mixed formulation that incorporates this physical feature. We propose a mixed numerical method where the stress is approximated with suitable Nédelec finite elements, whereas the velocity is approximated with piecewise polynomials of degree k≥0. With the aid of the compact operators theory we derive convergence of the method and spectral correctness. Moreover, we propose a reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimator for our spectral problem in order to provide an adaptive strategy to achieve the optimal order of convergence for non sufficient smooth eigenfunctions. We report numerical tests where the spectrum is computed, together with a computational analysis for the proposed estimator. In addition, we use the corresponding error estimator to drive an adaptive scheme, and we report the results of a numerical test, that allow us to assess the performance of this approach.}

abstract = {In two and three dimension we analyze discontinuous Galerkin methods (DG) for the acoustic vibration problem. Through all our study we consider an inviscid fluid, leading to a linear eigenvalue problem. The acoustic problem is written, in first place, in terms of the displacement. Under the approach of the non-compact operators theory, we prove convergence and error estimates for the method when the displacement formulation is considered. We analyze the influence of the stabilization parameter on the computation of the spectrum, where spurious eigenmodes arise when this parameter is not correctly chosen. Alternatively we present the formulation depending only on the pressure, comparing the performance of the DG methods with the pure displacement formulation. Computationally, we study the influence of the stabilization parameter on the arising of spurious eigenvalues when the spectrum is computed. Also, we report tests in two and three dimensions where convergence rates are reported, together with a comparison between the displacement and pressure formulations for the proposed DG methods.}

abstract = {Abstract In this article, we study a mathematical model that represents the concentration polarization and osmosis effects in a reverse osmosis cross-flow channel with dense membranes at some of its boundaries. The fluid is modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations and the solution-diffusion is used to impose the momentum balance on the membrane. The scheme consist of a conforming finite element method with the velocity–pressure formulation for the Navier–Stokes equations, together with a primal scheme for the convection–diffusion equations. The Nitsche's method is used to impose the permeability condition across the membrane. Several numerical experiments are performed to show the robustness of the method. The resulting model accurately replicates the analytical models and predicts similar results to previous works. It is found that the submerged configuration has the highest permeate production, but also has the greatest pressure loss of all three configurations studied.},
